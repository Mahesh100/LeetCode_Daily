# LeetCode

This Repositoary is created inorder to collect solved Leetcode problems everyday. The types of problems include
Easy, Medium and Hard stages.This collection will help to solve the leetcode problems with an ease.


#Problem 1

Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add 
up to target.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

You can return the answer in any order.

#Problem6

The string "PAYPALISHIRING" is written in a zigzag pattern on a given number of rows 
like this: (you may want to display this pattern in a fixed font for better  legibility.)


P   A   H   N
A P L S I I G
Y   I   R
And then read line by line: "PAHNAPLSIIGYIR"

Write the code that will take a string and make this conversion given a number of 
rows:

string convert(string s, int numRows);


Problem 09

Palindrome Number

Given an integer x, return true if x is palindrome integer.

An integer is a palindrome when it reads the same backward as forward. For example, 121 is palindrome while 123 is not.




#Problem 10  (Hard)


10. Regular Expression Matching

Given an input string (s) and a pattern (p), implement regular expression matching with support for '.' and '*' where: 

'.' Matches any single character.​​​​
'*' Matches zero or more of the preceding element.
The matching should cover the entire input string (not partial).



Problem 12 

Roman numerals are represented by seven different symbols: I, V, X, L, C, D and M.

Symbol       Value
I             1
V             5
X             10
L             50
C             100
D             500
M             1000
For example, 2 is written as II in Roman numeral, just two one's added together. 12 is written as XII, which is simply X + II. The number 27 is written as XXVII, which is XX + V + II.

Roman numerals are usually written largest to smallest from left to right. However, the numeral for four is not IIII. Instead, the number four is written as IV. Because the one is before the five we subtract it making four. The same principle applies to the number nine, which is written as IX. There are six instances where subtraction is used:

I can be placed before V (5) and X (10) to make 4 and 9. 
X can be placed before L (50) and C (100) to make 40 and 90. 
C can be placed before D (500) and M (1000) to make 400 and 900.
Given an integer, convert it to a roman numeral.

Container With Most Water 

Given n non-negative integers a1, a2, ..., an , where each represents a point at coordinate (i, ai). n vertical lines are drawn such that the two endpoints of the line i is at (i, ai) and (i, 0). Find two lines, which, together with the x-axis forms a container, such that the container contains the most water.

Notice that you may not slant the container.

Valid Parentheses

Given a string s containing just the characters '(', ')', '{', '}', '[' and ']', determine if the input string is valid.

An input string is valid if:

Open brackets must be closed by the same type of brackets.
Open brackets must be closed in the correct order.

# Problem 22

Generate Paranthies.

Given n pairs of parentheses, write a function to generate all combinations of well-formed parentheses.

 

Example 1:

Input: n = 3
Output: ["((()))","(()())","(())()","()(())","()()()"]
Example 2:

Input: n = 1
Output: ["()"]
 

Constraints:

1 <= n <= 8

/* #Problem 23

ou are given an array of k linked-lists lists, each linked-list is sorted in ascending order.

Merge all the linked-lists into one sorted linked-list and return it.

 

Example 1:

Input: lists = [[1,4,5],[1,3,4],[2,6]]
Output: [1,1,2,3,4,4,5,6]
Explanation: The linked-lists are:
[
  1->4->5,
  1->3->4,
  2->6
]
merging them into one sorted list:
1->1->2->3->4->4->5->6
Example 2:

Input: lists = []
Output: []
Example 3:

Input: lists = [[]]
Output: []

25. Reverse Nodes in k-Group

Given a linked list, reverse the nodes of a linked list k at a time and return its modified list.

k is a positive integer and is less than or equal to the length of the linked list. If the number of nodes is not a multiple of k then left-out nodes, in the end, should remain as it is.

Follow up:

Could you solve the problem in O(1) extra memory space?
You may not alter the values in the list's nodes, only nodes itself may be changed.

Problem 26


Given a sorted array nums, remove the duplicates in-place such that each element appears only once and returns the new length.

Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.

Clarification:

Confused why the returned value is an integer but your answer is an array?

Note that the input array is passed in by reference, which means a modification to the input array will be known to the caller as well.

Internally you can think of this:

// nums is passed in by reference. (i.e., without making a copy)
int len = removeDuplicates(nums);

// any modification to nums in your function would be known by the caller.
// using the length returned by your function, it prints the first len elements.
for (int i = 0; i < len; i++) {
    print(nums[i]);
}


class Solution {
    public int removeDuplicates(int[] nums) {
        if (nums == null || nums.length == 0) {
            return 0;
        }
        
        int i = 0;
        
        for (int j = 0; j < nums.length; j++) {
            if (nums[j] != nums[i]) {
                i++;
                nums[i] = nums[j];
            }            
        }

        // Space Complexity: O(1)

/* # 27 Remove Element

Given an array nums and a value val, remove all instances of that value in-place and return the new length.

Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.

The order of elements can be changed. It doesn't matter what you leave beyond the new length.

Clarification:

Note that the input array is passed in by reference, which means a modification to the input array will be known to the caller as well.

// any modification to nums in your function would be known by the caller.

#Problem 28 

28 . Implement strStr()

Implement strStr().

Return the index of the first occurrence of needle in haystack, 
or -1 if needle is not part of haystack.

Clarification:

What should we return when needle is an empty string? 
This is a great question to ask during an interview.

For the purpose of this problem, we will return 0 when needle is an empty string. 
This is consistent to C's strstr() and Java's indexOf().

Valid Suduko


etermine if a 9 x 9 Sudoku board is valid. Only the filled cells need to be validated according to the following rules:

Each row must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.
Each column must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.
Each of the nine 3 x 3 sub-boxes of the grid must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.
Note:

A Sudoku board (partially filled) could be valid but is not necessarily solvable.
Only the filled cells need to be validated according to the mentioned rules.
