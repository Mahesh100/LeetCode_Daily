# LeetCode

This Repositoary is created inorder to collect solved Leetcode problems everyday. The types of problems include
Easy, Medium and Hard stages.This collection will help to solve the leetcode problems with an ease.


#Problem 1

Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add 
up to target.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

You can return the answer in any order.

#Problem6

The string "PAYPALISHIRING" is written in a zigzag pattern on a given number of rows 
like this: (you may want to display this pattern in a fixed font for better  legibility.)


P   A   H   N
A P L S I I G
Y   I   R
And then read line by line: "PAHNAPLSIIGYIR"

Write the code that will take a string and make this conversion given a number of 
rows:

string convert(string s, int numRows);


Problem 09

Palindrome Number

Given an integer x, return true if x is palindrome integer.

An integer is a palindrome when it reads the same backward as forward. For example, 121 is palindrome while 123 is not.





Problem 12 

Roman numerals are represented by seven different symbols: I, V, X, L, C, D and M.

Symbol       Value
I             1
V             5
X             10
L             50
C             100
D             500
M             1000
For example, 2 is written as II in Roman numeral, just two one's added together. 12 is written as XII, which is simply X + II. The number 27 is written as XXVII, which is XX + V + II.

Roman numerals are usually written largest to smallest from left to right. However, the numeral for four is not IIII. Instead, the number four is written as IV. Because the one is before the five we subtract it making four. The same principle applies to the number nine, which is written as IX. There are six instances where subtraction is used:

I can be placed before V (5) and X (10) to make 4 and 9. 
X can be placed before L (50) and C (100) to make 40 and 90. 
C can be placed before D (500) and M (1000) to make 400 and 900.
Given an integer, convert it to a roman numeral.



Problem 20
Valid Parentheses

Given a string s containing just the characters '(', ')', '{', '}', '[' and ']', determine if the input string is valid.

An input string is valid if:

Open brackets must be closed by the same type of brackets.
Open brackets must be closed in the correct order.
